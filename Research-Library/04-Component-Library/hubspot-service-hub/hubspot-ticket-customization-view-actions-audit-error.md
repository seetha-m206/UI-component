## Behavior & States

- **DOCUMENTED:** Independently addressable as hubspot-ticket-customization-view-actions-audit-error.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** Evidence-bounded error, unavailable, validation, retry, and failure states for HubSpot Ticket Customization View Actions. The source record does not directly observe this state, so the fixture is a labelled local reconstruction.
