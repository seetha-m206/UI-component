# Component: Salesforce Bulk Selection Error Toast

Product → Screen → Component → Action → Behavior → States → Rules → Technical Data

## Location

- **OBSERVED:** Salesforce Lightning trial workspace, cases surface, inspected on 2026-10-06 via Codex CUA. Service and its companion Automation area were inspected. Exact commercial edition and full Service Cloud entitlement remain unverified.
- **OBSERVED:** Section entry: `/lightning/o/Case/list?filterName=AllOpenCases`. The exact resulting route and timestamp are retained in private source receipts. This is not a claim that every component shares the section entry route.

## Screenshot

![Fictional local reconstruction](/research/salesforce-service-cloud/fixtures/salesforce-bulk-selection-toast.png)

- **RECONSTRUCTION:** The image is an isolated local example. People, assets, connector examples, dates and non-empty rows are invented. It is not a provider screenshot.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** This is a viewport screenshot at the browser default size. Long forms and catalogues continue below the captured area. The interactive preview supports scrolling. It is not a full-page capture.
- **OBSERVED:** Private receipt `bulk-selection-error-toast-live` includes a screenshot and rendered DOM/AX text in `Internal/scratch-2026-10/salesforce-service-cloud/screens-actions-20261006/provider/`. Original screenshots remain private because some contain account identity.

## Structure

- **OBSERVED:** Error notification states Select at least one record and try again, with Close and keyboard navigation guidance.

## Actions

| Element and action | Observed result or untouched boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Activate Change Owner with zero records selected | The selection warning appears. No ownership form or change occurs. |

## Behavior & States

- **OBSERVED:** Only the named capture and the action result above establish live behavior. Loading placeholders were allowed to settle before being treated as populated or empty states. An attempted action alone is not success evidence.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** Local filtering, tabs, pickers, selection, calendar navigation and disclosure controls operate on fictional in-memory state. They are implementation demonstrations, not additional provider observations.
- **NOT OBSERVED:** Behavior with selected rows, owner picker, permission checks and successful changes are unobserved.

## Rules & Validation

- **OBSERVED:** Required markers, defaults, disabled controls and visible empty-field warnings are evidence only where explicitly described above.
- **NOT OBSERVED:** Provider submission, server validation and durable outcomes were not exercised. No relationship or permission rule is inferred from appearance.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** Save, send, enable, export, connect, run, subscribe, share and delete controls only show a local boundary notice. Forms prevent submission. There is no provider request path.

## Technical Data

- **OBSERVED / DOM:** Rendered headings, dialog roles, labelled inputs, menus, list options, tab selections, table headers and disabled states support the documented structure. Action parameter tables are UI declarations only.
- **RECONSTRUCTION / CSS:** The example uses system fonts, blue actions, white cards, light gray surfaces, thin borders, compact tables and adaptive local layout based on the captured appearance. Dimensions and mobile breakpoints are local choices.
- **NOT OBSERVED / Network:** No request bodies, responses, cookies, credentials or API contracts were inspected or retained.
- **NOT OBSERVED / JavaScript:** Private framework state, event handlers, persistence logic and permission implementation were not inspected.
- **NOT OBSERVED / Motion:** Timing, reduced-motion behavior and provider transitions are unmeasured.

## Accessibility

- **OBSERVED:** Safe controls were activated with keyboard Enter or Space and resulting DOM was inspected. This is not a full provider accessibility audit.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** Local controls have accessible names, visible focus and native inputs. Modal examples trap focus and restore the opener on dismissal. Native select styling is not a pixel-exact recreation of provider listboxes.

## Human Context

- **RECOMMENDATION:** Reuse the observed composition as a design reference while keeping fictional interactions and untested provider outcomes separate.

## AI Context

- **OBSERVED:** Authenticated Lightning trial interface, dated 2026-10-06. Catalogue grouping follows the Salesforce Service research lane, including its companion Automation surfaces.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** All preview identities and data are fictional and stay local.
- **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Behavior with selected rows, owner picker, permission checks and successful changes are unobserved.

## Best Observed Approach

- **RECOMMENDATION:** Preserve the component-specific grouping and disclosure hierarchy. Evidence does not establish superiority, production readiness or complete product support.

## Needs Verification

- **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Behavior with selected rows, owner picker, permission checks and successful changes are unobserved.
- **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Provider mobile behavior, error paths, access control and saved state require separate evidence. A zero-row view is not proof of absence across the workspace.

## Sources

- **OBSERVED:** Private provider receipt `bulk-selection-error-toast-live`, screen/action batch 2026-10-06.
- **OBSERVED:** Sanitized public index `/research/salesforce-service-cloud/capture-manifest.json` contains receipt hashes, not private captures.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** `src/previews/salesforce-service-shared/SalesforceActions.tsx` and `actionCatalogue.ts` back the local example.
