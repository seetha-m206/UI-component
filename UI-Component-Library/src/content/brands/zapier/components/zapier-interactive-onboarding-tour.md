## Structure

- **OBSERVATION:** Embedded one-minute product tour with trigger/action, Copilot, Paths, AI, Interfaces and Tables chapters.

## Actions

| Action | Observed result or boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Open Watch an overview | Read-only disclosure or local fixture state only |
| Advance through the embedded chapters | Read-only disclosure or local fixture state only |
| Close the tour without selecting the final call to action | Read-only disclosure or local fixture state only |

## Behavior & States

- **OBSERVATION:** The named screen, disclosure, selected tab, disabled control and empty state were recorded only when visible.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** Preview controls change fictional local React state or show a boundary notice.
- **NOT OBSERVED:** No external trial, sales link or workflow creation was started.

## Rules & Validation

- **OBSERVATION:** Disabled controls and unavailable actions remain visibly disabled in the documented state.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** Consequential controls cannot contact Zapier from the preview.

## Technical Data

- **OBSERVATION / DOM:** The inspected state exposed semantic headings, buttons, links, tabs, inputs, dialogs, lists or status text as applicable.
- **OBSERVATION / ROUTE:** Account identifiers, query identifiers and opaque draft identifiers are intentionally removed.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** Shared renderer is `src/previews/zapier-shared/ZapierPreview.tsx`.
- **NOT OBSERVED / NETWORK:** Provider request bodies, response contracts, persistence and connected-app consequences were not inspected.

## Accessibility

- **OBSERVATION:** Visible controls exposed names and disabled, selected, expanded or checked states where applicable.
- **RECONSTRUCTION:** The fictional preview uses native labelled controls and live status messages.

## Evidence Boundary

- **NOT OBSERVED:** No external trial, sales link or workflow creation was started.
- **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Provider responsive behavior, permission variants and completed workflow consequences remain open.

## Sources

- **OBSERVATION:** Authenticated, read-only Zapier inspection on 2026-10-08.
